# StockUp
A group project where my group and I had to find a real world issue and solve it by developing a mock system. 
Our client was Elgin Free Range Chickens and we developed an ordering system for stores to order new stock. 

The system compromises of a store user, a dispatch user and an admin user interface. 
The store user interface will allow the store user to place an order based on a list of products. 
The dispatch interface will allow dispatch staff to view all the orders and export them to a CSV file in order to allow for printing. 
The admin interface will allow for the adding of users, products and stores. It also allows admin users to view all the information contained within the system. 

The database has been hosted online.
